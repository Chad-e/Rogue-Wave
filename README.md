# Rogue-Wave

This is an example of the code used to generate the plots and results for my publication Onset times of long-lived rogue waves in an optical waveguide array published in Journal of the Optical Society of America A Vol. 37, Issue 11, pp. C67-C72 (2020).

I have not included the code to produce the final plots that show the onset times, although this can be easily added and checked against the paper.
